# ML Quick Draw

Machine Learning Project for the course "Machine Learning" at FH Hagenberg with the Google "Quick, Draw!"
dataset (https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset)

We want to evaluate the performance of detecting a picture a user draws on his electronic device, such as a computer,
with different various kinds of machine learning (ML) algorithms. The data the user draws is available as a bitmap.

## Goal

We want to know how different ML algorithms perform with different hyper-parameters and give an analysis how different
settings impact the performance of the trained model. The used models are compared with each other, and the goal is to
use the “easiest” model to classify those drawings.

## Dataset

Google provides the data of the drawings, which were recorded in their game Quick,
Draw! (https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/). The dataset is available under the following
link: https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset. The Quick Draw Dataset is a collection of 50 million
drawings across 345 categories. The drawings were captured as timestamped vectors, tagged with metadata including what
the player was asked to draw and in which country the player was located.
